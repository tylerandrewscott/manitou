<td style='border-bottom: 2px solid grey; text-align: center;'>Our company East Fork Lumber Company depends on the salvage of timber from the Forest Service as our timber resource. I think it is essential that the importance of salvage to economic and social health of our rural communities be recognized.  This is very crucial part of any NEPA document.  The inclusion of larger diameter trees is also important to any balanced salvage plan. It is important that not only large modern mills that process small diameter logs but also small mills that create a wide array of special products from larger diameter trees be included in any salvage plan. The harvest of these larger diameter trees are important to a healthy, complex and varied timber industry. This especially true in our rural communities. To omit such trees creates sales that favors only large modern sawmill and discriminates against the small locally owned wood processors.    I encourage to move promptly in the salvage of this timber. I also encourage you to include all age classes and species of trees in multiple small salvage sales to encourage the widest possible participation of the public. It has been my experience that only a small volume of timber is ever harvested from any fire on our National Forests.  It is also my experience through repeated visits and surveys of post harvested fire salvage areas that environmental impact of fire salvage is negligible.</td>
<td style='border-bottom: 2px solid grey; text-align: center;'>topic #9:  Please protect sage grouse, sagebrush habitat, and the sage grouse plans. I, along with the hundreds of thousands of Americans, have taken action for years urging agencies to do everything necessary to conserve the greater sage-grouse and the sagebrush ecosystem. The U.S. Forest Service's mission is to conserve fish and wildlife so please stay true to your obligation to protect the diversity of species in our National Greater sage-grouse conservation plans  were the result of historic collaborative efforts resulting in the largest land based conservation effort in our country's history.  In addition to the sage grouse,  the plan saves over  plant and wildlife species that rely on a healthy sagebrush ecosystem,  the largest land based ecosystem remaining in the I am specifically concerned with proposed changes in the Forest Service's sage grouse management plans that open these lands to increased development.  Specifically the proposed changes would remove Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFA) designations, reduce Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) and expand opportunities for waivers, exceptions and modifications to no surface occupancy (NSO) stipulations Please, listen to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have urged Federal agencies to honor the deal made with western communities three years ago and leave the plans to conserve the greater sage-grouse
topic #49:  I am writing to support the No-Action Alternative for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed Alaska Roadless Rule. I strongly object to your plans to reduce and remove protections from roadless areas on the Tongass National Forest. The Tongass contains some of the last remaining old-growth temperate rainforest in the world, and its value in providing clean water and fish and wildlife habitat is essential to the economic and ecological health of Southeast Alaska. Furthermore, it's a critical carbon sink to combat climate change. I urge you to keep the federal Roadless Rule intact and current protections in place for national forests in Alaska. Adopted in , the National Forest Roadless Area Conservation Rule is one of our nation's bedrock conservation protections intended to safeguard more than  million acres of national forests. From  to , the Forest Service held over  public meetings nationwide, including  throughout Washington State. In what was one of the most extensive public participation efforts in the history of federal rulemaking, more than . million people commented during the rulemaking process, with % supporting strong roadless area protection. The Roadless Rule is one of the most balanced and most popular land management policies the Federal Government has ever adopted. It protects our remaining ancient forests, pristine and unroaded watershed, core wildlife habitat and world class recreational opportunities, while leaving more than half of the national forest system available for sustainable logging and other development. </td>
